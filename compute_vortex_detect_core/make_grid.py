    """
    A class for interpolating unstructured flow field data onto a structured rectangular grid.
    
    This class performs linear interpolation to convert scattered CFD/PIV data points onto
    a regular Cartesian grid suitable for visualization and analysis. It supports airfoil
    surface masking and handles multiple flow variables simultaneously.

        Perform the actual grid interpolation and optional airfoil masking.
        
        This method creates a structured rectangular grid and interpolates all flow
        variables from the unstructured input data. If airfoil masking is enabled,
        it identifies regions inside the airfoil surface and masks them appropriately.

            The airfoil surface is identified by regions where |u| < 1e-3,
